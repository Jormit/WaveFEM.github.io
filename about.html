    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>WaveFEM is a program that began as hobby to understand the principles of electromagnetic simulation. The core simulation
      kernel is written from first principles enabling it to be highly performant and extendable. Without the overhead of a large
      corporation, we can offer simulation software at a fraction of the cost which is ideal for students and hobbyists.

      <li>Radiation boundaries using PMLs</li>
      <li>Farfield computation via integrated near to farifield transformation</li>
      <li>Fast vector fitting implementation for interpolating sweeps</li>
      <li>Support for importing multi-object .step files</li>
      <li>Lumped ports and wave ports</li>
      <li>Integrated 2D eigensolver supporting both TEM and TE modes</li>
      <li>GUI which be used for material and port assignment</li>
      <li>Parametric models defined via cadquery scripts</li>
      <li>Importing planar formats such as .gds and gerber with inbuilt substrate editor</li>      
    </ul>
