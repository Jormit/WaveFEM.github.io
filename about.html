  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>WaveFEM is a program that began as hobby to understand the principles of electromagnetic simulation. The core simulation
     code is written from scratch enabling it to be highly performant and extendable. The core dependencies are GMSH for meshing,
     EIGEN for Linear algebra and Pyvista for 3d Graphics.

  <h2>Formulation</h2>
  <p>The program utilizes a modern approach to electromagnetic simulation using mixed-order Hierarchal vector basis
     functions, similar to the method used by commercial solvers such as HFSS. Perfectly-Matched Layers are used for
     implementing absorbing boundary conditions, and a near-to-far field method is used to calculate radiation patterns.
